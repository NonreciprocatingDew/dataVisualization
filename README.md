# dataVisualization
a brief project to look into methods of data visualization -- these are projects from the book Python Crash Course

1. Die Rolls
This first project looks to roll a dX die a number of times and graph the data in a histogram.
  
Key Points:
i. it can roll any side die
ii. it can roll it any number of times
iii. it will automatically label the x-axis based off of the total possibilities

Challenges:
i. getting user input to define the variables listed above
ii. creating a die for each number requested by the user
